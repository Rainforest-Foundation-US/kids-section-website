# Rainforest Foundation US - Kids' Corner

This is the Kids' Corner website for the Rainforest Foundation US. It is built with Next.js, TypeScript and TailwindCSS.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project so this guide is going to assume you have a basic understanding of Next.js, as well as of TypeScript and TailwindCSS.

These are the versions we're using:

- Node.js: v18.12.x
- npm: 8.x.x
- Next.js: 13.1.2
- TypeScript: 4.9.4
- TailwindCSS: 3.2.4

Make sure you have the correct versions of Node.js and npm installed to run the project. You can check your versions by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.

We use `npm` as our package manager.

### Running the website in development mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

By default, the website's server tries to use port 3000 (in which case go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result) but if that port is already in use, it will try to use port 3001, or 3002, and so on.
